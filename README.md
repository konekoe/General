# Konekoe

Konekoe is a exam digitalization project which originates from Aalto University, Finland. The project consists of a framework of 
secure operating system (ExamOS), hardening tools for the OS (examtool bundle), web interface (konekoe-server and its backend services) 
and a web-based programming IDE (konekoe-exercise-server) which acts like a LMS for exam assignment collection and grading. 

The development was mostly done by Jussi Hietanen (Client side) and Lari Alakukku (Server side). All original work done in Aalto is licensed 
under MIT license. However, some derivative works (for example examosbuilder being GPLv3) are licensed under their original licenses.
